# Predicting-type-of-ticket-sales-for-NCAA-Women-Basketball

# Situation: 
NCAA Division I women's basketball has been enjoying increased popularity, with attendance figures breaking records for two consecutive years. Despite this success, there were opportunities to further enhance audience size and revenues, particularly during the initial rounds of the tournaments, where attendance was notably lower compared to regionals and finals.

# Task: 
The project was aimed at leveraging detailed ticket sales and customer behavior data from the 2022 and 2023 seasons to generate actionable insights that could help the NCAA optimize ticket sales, enhance fan engagement, and improve overall event management. The key challenge was to identify strategic interventions that could be implemented to sustain and grow the sport's popularity.

# Action: 
The team took several strategic steps to address these challenges:

# Analysis of Ticket Sales:
Developed predictive models using Kaggle to analyze ticket purchase data, event types, and facility considerations.
Identified that the first and second rounds had lower attendance compared to later rounds, indicating a need for targeted marketing strategies in these initial rounds.

# Unusual Customer Behavior Detection:
Analyzed customer purchase patterns and identified anomalies where customers bought multiple tickets for events happening simultaneously in different locations, suggesting potential reselling behaviors.
Recommended monitoring these customer IDs to prevent reselling and ensure that tickets are sold to genuine fans at fair prices.

# Model Development and Insights:
Built an ensemble model consisting of LinearSVC, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to predict different types of ticket purchases with an accuracy of over 98%.
Used key features derived from the model to enhance the NCAA's understanding of customer behaviors and preferences, integrating these insights into a Tableau dashboard for real-time application.

# Predictive Analytics for Venue Selection:
Analyzed factors such as Google trends, state diversity, and venue capacities to recommend potential locations for future regional events, aiming to maximize attendance and fan engagement.

# Result: 
The project successfully utilized advanced data analytics to provide the NCAA with a comprehensive strategy for increasing ticket sales, detecting and mitigating potential fraud, and understanding diverse customer behaviors. The actionable insights generated allowed for targeted marketing in both host and non-host cities, optimized ticket pricing strategies, and enhanced overall fan experience. This holistic approach marked a significant advancement in the NCAA's operational and marketing endeavors, paving the way for sustained growth and success in women's basketball.
